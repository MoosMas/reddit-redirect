# Reddit Redirect

This extension offers the same functionality as the original Old Reddit Redirect, but now you can also turn the redirect off.

## How to use
It's enabled by default, but you can disable it by clicking the extension icon. You can then freely browse Reddit in the redesign. Clicking the icon again enables it and refreshing the page redirects you to old Reddit.
